Brief: LLM parameters and fine-tuning, specifically LoRA and QLoRA

Topics Covered
- LLM parameters
- Need for finetuning
- Theory behid LoRA and QLoRA
- Hugging face
- Hugging face model inference
- Fine tuning using hugging face PEFT methods

To be done
- Go through the code on lora-cv and lora-squad for understanding of how lora and qlora works to fine tune a model to either improve its dataset or make it better at a particular task.
- Task will be provided on this class
