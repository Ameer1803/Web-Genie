Brief: Task 1 submissions + Mid Evaluation + Next Steps

Task 1 submission points:
- Complete the entire task, that includes making javascript logic
- Submission logic where user gets details on what they've booked
- Good UI means user wants to be clicking on show/flight and book
- Loved the submissions with intuitive JS logic (random seats/ line break after 8 seats/ etc)
- Readme is important for people to have a good first impression on opening your repository - include Details, features and Setup
- Organise your files well - js, css and html files seperately and assets folder

Mid Evaluation
- Unofficial group - Remember, this is your project, you are going to define how we present it, since it is about what you learnt
- Latex Report to be submitted from our side, include everything we have learnt up until now, divide among yourselves.
- Presentation is upto your creativity, it should showcase everything you learnt, signifying strong webdev skills and LLM applications. 

Next Steps
- A well deserved break after mid eval for a bit
- Focus on RAG, prompting and simple agents on the LLM side and Hosting, Deployment and backend integration on WEB side
